    "The e-commerce market has been growing rapidly over the past few years, and the Covid-19 pandemic has further enhanced this effect by making irreversible changes in consumer habits. Currently, one of the fastest growing e-commerce markets in Europe is Poland. Companies such as: Allegro, OLX, Amazon, Aliexpress have an average daily turnover of several million baskets. [PWC](https://www.pwc.pl/pl/media/2021-02-09-analiza-pwc-prognoza-rozwoju-rynku-ecommerce-w-polsce.html) estimated that in 2026 the gross value of the Polish e-commerce market will be at the level of 162 billion PLN. \n",

    "In order to handle such volume of parcels, well-functioning logistics companies are required to deliver the ordered parcel within a short time from the order. In Poland, there are several international logistic companies, e.g. DHL, DPD; Poczta Polska is an important local player; however, InPost enjoys the greatest recognition among customers. Its success has two sources: firstly, InPost has developed a network of parcel machines (Paczkomat) which have revolutionized the way we receive parcels; secondly, InPost has perfectly operationalized logistics thus is able to deliver parcels in a very short time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the obvious elements of InPost's successful logistics is an appropriate deployment strategy for parcel pick-up points. This point determines how convenient the InPost service is for the end user. As we suppose, the models that determine the choice of a spatial point to place a Paczkomat are not ideal because they do not naturally take into account constraints such as the inability to lease a given point in space. Thus, departments responsible for the expansion of new pick-up points can often make decisions about placing a parcel machine in an intuitive way (for instance close to the shopping mall), without statistical basis (they probably have their own targets to achieve - to receive bonuses and they do not care about evaluation of their choice in the short/mid-term). In addition, recently, more and more competitors for InPost have appeared (adopting the same model of delivery into parcel machine), such as Ruch or even Poczta Polska. It seems to be logical that they possibly copy the deployment choices of InPost. Therefore, it seems very interesting to analyze how InPost's pick-up points deployment situation looks like compared to the competition. In addition, it is worth verifying whether the deployment determinants of InPost's Paczkomats are consistent with the literature. We are referring here to the [Morganti et al. (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210539514000078) publication which suggests such indicators of pick-up point deployment: demographic indicators (population density, employment rate, computer ownership, Internet access), centers and nodes for city users (\"parameters related to end-consumers' mobility and accessibility to socio-economic activities, in particular end-consumers' use of both public transport and private cars, and the density of retail outlets and commercial services, business and employment sites, cultural and leisure centers and public transportation nodes\"), parcels flow within the network (mostly related to the transport system and users preferences).\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to examine the deployment strategy of InPost parcel pick-up points compared to the competition in multivariate environment. Furthermore, we want to test whether the deployment determinants (herein referred to as control variables) indicated by the literature and our modeling intuition are relevant to InPost's strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "We state following research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does InPost have parcel pick-up points deployed in line with the competition?\n",
    "2. Do control variables affect the number of InPost pickup points in a given area?\n",
    "3. Are spatial effects significant in multivariate econometric models?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the above research questions, we conducted a full econometric analysis based primarily on spatial statistics and spatial models. In order to simplify the computational complexity of the task, we focused only on two cities in Poland: Warsaw and Cracow. These are two key cities from the point of view of InPost (Warsaw - the capital of Poland, Krakow - where InPost was established). Depending on the modeling approach we used different levels of data aggregation for Spatial dependence models - grid 1km x 1km, for Spatial drift models - point data. We are testing those approaches because in this problem, both Spatial Autocorrelation and Spatial Drift seem to be intuitive phenomena.\n",
